# CI-VTS

## Installation (rough edit)

Required to run:
1. PySide6, get from `pip install pyside6`. Official Installation guide can be found [here][2].
2. pytqtgraph _0.11.1dev0_.<br/>
   IMPORTTANT NOTE:
   This version, as opposed to v0.11.1, may not install correctly from
   simply running`pip install pyqtgraph`, strongly recommend building from source as per the instructions on the [pyqtgraph homepage][1].
